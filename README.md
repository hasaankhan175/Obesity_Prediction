# 🧠 Obesity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether an individual is obese or not based on various physical and lifestyle attributes using Machine Learning. It involves end-to-end implementation — from data preprocessing and visualization to model building and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- Age:	The age of the individual
- Gender:	The gender of the individual
- Height:	The height of the individual (in centimeters)
- Weight:	The weight of the individual (in kilograms)
- BMI:	The Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual
- PhysicalActivityLevel:	The level of physical activity of the individual
- ObesityCategory:	The category of obesity based on BMI
